# The Basics

_LearnAll Language School_ offers courses on several languages. You may choose between different styles of learning, or let us find the better style for you, by answering a simple questionnaire. For reference, the default style is the "Duolingo Mode". Check a quick reference of each mode below.

## Duolingo Mode

Duolingo method is based on repetition of an incremental amount of phrases, ranging from 1 word to long sentences. Once you've mastered a few new phrases, you can advance to the next lesson and get a handful of new phrases to test on.

The progress is linear, meaning you have to complete one lesson to unlock the next one, and so on. There are quite a few review lessons, however, that focus on presenting learned material again, making sure you've grasped it.

The Duolingo platform is fully gamified, so anything you do can be framed in the context a competition against other players.

- Pros:
  - repetition is proven to be a very effective and valid way of learning a language
  - gamification is a great incentive to make students spend more time learning
- Cons:
  - learners tend to "guess" the answers based on visual recognition, without properly understanding or inspecting them
  - gamification is a double-edged sword: the goal of beating other players tends to encourage spending more time on lessons which are already fully learned

  Newcomers who have no experience with other learning methods should try this one first, and gradually consider other methods.

  ## TODO : add other modes as they're developed
